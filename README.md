Part II: Distributed Machine Learning with Spark (32 points)
Apache Spark ML is a machine learning library that consists of common learning algorithms and utilities, including classification, regression, clustering, collaborative filtering, dimensionality reduction, and underlying optimization primitives.

Why Spark ML?

Standard implementations of machine learning algorithms require very powerful machines to be able to run. However, depending on high-end machines is not advantageous due to their high price and improper costs of scaling up. The idea of using distributed computing engines is to distribute the calculations to multiple low-end machines (commodity hardware) instead of a single high-end one. This definitely speeds up the learning phase and allows us to create better models.
